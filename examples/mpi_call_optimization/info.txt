Simulations:
	|- Evaporation:
		|- Simulation of a liquid into the vacuum
	|- mkesfera:
		|- Simulation of a sphere surrounded by single molecules
	|- Standard-VLE:
		|- Simulation of a standard vapor-liquid-equilibrium(CO2)

Each simulation has different configuration-files to recreate scenarios of BA: Optimizing MPI Load Balancing in ls1 mardyn; Jeremy Harisch
