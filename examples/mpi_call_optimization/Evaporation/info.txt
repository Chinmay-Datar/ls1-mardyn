sim01/run01: 
	|- equilibrate liquid phase
  	|- small liquid phase for system creation, liquid reservoir
  
sim02/run01: 
	|- Usage of sim01/run01
	|- evaporation into vacuum
  	|- Const. feed rate to populate vapor 
	|- Simulates the evaporation of a liquid into the vacuum

sim02 was used for evaluation in BA: Optimizing MPI Load Balancing in ls1 mardyn; Jeremy Harisch.
