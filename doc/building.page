/*! \page "Building Mardyn" 

!!! Makefile

CD into the src directory, type

\verbatim
make -f ../makefile/Makefile PARTYPE=SEQ TARGET=DEBUG UNIT_TESTS=1 VTK=1 -j3
\endverbatim

Building using the makefile should always work, as this is the only reliable way 
to build Mardyn on clusters / supercomputers. 

Note that dependency tracking does not work properly, so better always do a 
"make clean"...

!!! Eclipse

(recommended for development)

Download and install Eclipse CDT (http://www.eclipse.org/) together with the 
Subclipse Plugin (SVN client, available at http://subclipse.tigris.org/).

The following screen shots show the settings to build Mardyn sequentially in debug mode:
