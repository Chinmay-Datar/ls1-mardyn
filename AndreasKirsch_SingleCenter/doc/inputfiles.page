! 1CLJGen

<b>Note This particle generator doesn't produce input which is physically correct
      in any way. It's intended to be used just to test technical stuff!</b>

Generates 1-Center-Lennard-Jones molecules as input. There are two 
modes, "Homogeneous" or "Cluster". Independent of the mode, the generator needs 
two more parameters, the number of molecules and the temperature.

In any case, the size of the simulation box is calculated automatically.

- "Homogeneous"
Creates a homogeneous distribution of a gas. The molecules are distributet randomly
within the domain. The generator takes one more parameter, the density of the gas.

A line could look like
\verbatim
#                      mode        N     T  rho
phaseSpaceFile 1CLJGen Homogeneous 20000 10 0.08
\endverbatim

- "Cluster"
Create a inhomogeneous distribution, i.e. a scenario where molecules are clustered
as drops in a gas phase. Apart from N and T, the generator takes the following 
additional parameters:
	- the density of the gas
	- the density of the fluid (i.e. in the drops)
	- the percentage of volume covered by the drops (in percent)
	- the volume of the largest drops (in percent of the total volume)
	- the number of sphere-classes. The drops of a class have a radius 0.9 * radius
	  of the drops of the larger class.

A line could look like
\verbatim
#                      mode    N     T   rho_gas  rho_fluid  fluidVolume  maxSphereVolume  numSphereSizes
