//! @brief class to represent that particle data that is necessary for the exchange between processes
//! @author Martin Buchholz
//!
//! The data that has to be transfered for each particle consists of several values of different
//! types. As MPI-commands are expensive, it is desirable to transfer all data with a single
//! command. Therefore, two things have to be done:
//! - The data has to be "packed together", so all data at succeeding memory locations
//! - A MPI-datatype has to be defined.
//! This class achieves both. It is a class without constructor and destructor and only static
//! methods, which means that only the member variables use memory, so it can be used like a
//! C stuct. The static method setMPIType sets the given type to represent all the member variables.
