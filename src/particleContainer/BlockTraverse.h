//! @brief BlockTraverse datastructure
//! @author Johannes Wei√ül
//!
//! This datastructure is there to prevent code duplication in LinkedCells and AdaptiveSubCells classes.
//! The traversePairs() method in these classes are very similar, except for
//! - naming (cells <-> subCells), etc.
//! - offsets (NeighbourOffsets equal for every cell <-> different for every cell)
//! This class contains a generic traversePairs() method and all needed member variables. There are two
//! constructors to deal with the different datastructures for the offsets in LinkedCells and AdaptiveSubCells.
