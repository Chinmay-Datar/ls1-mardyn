/*! \page "Building and Running Mardyn" 

!!! Makefile

Building using the makefile should always work, as this is the only reliable way 
to build Mardyn on clusters / supercomputers. 

Note that dependency tracking does not work properly, so better always do a 
"make clean"...

!! Sequential Version

To build Mardyn in the sequential version (i.e. for single processor use), 
CD into the src directory, type

\verbatim
make -f ../makefile/Makefile PARTYPE=SEQ TARGET=DEBUG UNIT_TESTS=1 VTK=1 -j3
\endverbatim

!! Running sequential

- The most reliable thing is to copy the executable as well as all(!) input files
  into the same directory.
- Execute 
\verbatim
./MarDyn lj40000_t300.cfg 10
\endverbatim
where lj40000_t300.cfg is the scenario file and 10 iterations are performed

!! Parallel Version

To build Mardyn in the parallel version for MPI, CD into the src directory, type

\verbatim
make -f ../makefile/Makefile PARTYPE=PAR TARGET=DEBUG UNIT_TESTS=1 VTK=1 -j3
\endverbatim

!!! Eclipse

(recommended for development)

Download and install Eclipse CDT (http://www.eclipse.org/) together with the 
Subclipse Plugin (SVN client, available at http://subclipse.tigris.org/).
